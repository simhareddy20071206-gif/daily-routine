Alright **Narasimha**, I’m giving you a **clean, strict, Mob-Psycho-style routine**, aligned with your college timings, your ambition, and your brain’s limits.

I know your pattern:

* Mornings you struggle a bit
* Evenings you have more power
* You want high discipline
* You want NO wasted time
* You want to grind like you’re possessed

So here is the exact, **no-negotiation**, **follow-or-die** plan:

---

# 🛏️ **SLEEP — EXACT NUMBER OF HOURS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**

To maintain **6 hours deep focus + college**, you need:

## **👉 EXACTLY 7 hours of sleep.**

Not 6.
Not 8.
**7 hours.**

Why 7?
Because:

* 6 hours → burnout in 1 week
* 8 hours → too relaxed, makes mornings dull
* 7 hours → peak cognitive + sustainable for years

This is the optimum for elite-focused people.

# 🔥 DAILY ROUTINE (MOB MODE)

## 🌅 **Morning Routine (2 hours of deep DSA)**

**Wake up: 6:00 AM**
(If you sleep at 11 PM → perfect 7 hours)

### **6:15–7:45 AM → 1.5 hours DSA (fresh brain = best problem solving)**

* Hard problem or pattern learning
* No phone
* No distractions
* Only one tab open
* Mob-style silence

### **7:45–8:00 → 15 min quick recap or notes**

This locks in memory.

### **8:00 → Breakfast + get ready for college**

---

# 🏫 **College Hours (Use micro slots)**

Mob behavior during college:

### ✔ During breaks: 5–10 min → read notes

### ✔ Between classes: revise patterns

### ✔ Walking: mentally rehearse problems

### ✔ Lunch: quick DSA observation or ML flashcard

No time wasting.
No useless talking.
No random scrolling.

Become the *quiet guy with dangerous focus*.

---

# 🌇 **Evening Routine (4 hours grind)**

### **6:00–8:00 PM → AI/ML Core + Math (2 hours)**

Alternate:

* Day 1: ML algorithms
* Day 2: Linear algebra / calculus
* Day 3: Python/NumPy/Pandas
* Day 4: ML projects
* Then repeat

### **8:00–8:30 → Dinner + Brain Cooldown**

NO phone during dinner
NO reels
NO scrolling

### **8:30–10:00 PM → DSA Practice (1.5 hours)**

* Solve 2–3 problems
* 1 medium
* 1 slightly hard
* Review solutions

### **10:00–10:30 PM → Revision + Plan for Tomorrow (30 min)**

### **11:00 PM → Sleep**

Mob mode = strict sleep discipline.

Sundays are **NOT off days** for someone with your dream.
But they are also **NOT normal grind days** like weekdays.

Sunday is your **reset + rebuild + level-up day.**
This is how REAL long-term killers operate.

Here is EXACTLY what your **Mob Psycho–style Sunday** should look like:

---

# 🔥 **SUNDAY ROUTINE (THE 0.1% VERSION)**

Total study time: **6 hours**, same as weekdays
But the *distribution* and *intensity* change.

# 🌅 **Morning — 3 hours (Peak Focus)**

You’re not tired from college today → morning becomes your strongest time.

### **6:00 – 6:30 AM — Walk + Breath + Mind reset**

Mob-style silence.
No music.
No phone.
Just calmness.

Reason: Prepares your mind for a monster-level session.

Hard problems.
Graph/Binary search/Sliding window advanced.
This is your weekly improvement block.

### **10:00 – 11:00 AM — ML/MATH Theory**

Pick ONE topic and go deep:

Sunday = depth.

# 🕒 **Afternoon — Optional Power Rest (NOT sleep)**

Not sleeping.
Just resetting.

(If you sleep afternoon → night ruined → Monday ruined.)

This is what builds your future resume:

Do things like:
